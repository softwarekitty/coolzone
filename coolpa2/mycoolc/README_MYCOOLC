actually, mycoolc is just a shell using 'csh' - try reading the file to see the piped script.
surprise!  you will need to install csh to use this program.
>sudo apt-get install csh
then...
>./mycoolc someCoolFile.cl
>./spim -file someCoolFile.s
and you are done testing and running the file.  Perhaps we should automate this?
